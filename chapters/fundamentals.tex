\section{Pitch}
\begin{definition}[Pitch]
    Pitch is the property of the sound which allows a relative ordering of perceived sounds on a frequency-related scale.
\end{definition}
On a keyboard, pitch goes up to the right of the keyboard, while it goes down on the left.

Pitches are expressed through \textbf{notes}. There are 7 note names\footnote{C-B in anglophone countries, C-H in Germany and Do-Si for the rest of Europe.}, which are repeated in \textbf{octave registers}, identified by the bottom number.
$$\cdots A_3 B_3 \underbrace{C_4 D_4 E_4 F_4 G_4 A_4 B_4}_{\text{Octave register 4}} C_5 D_5 \cdots$$

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Octave]
    The distance / interval between two notes with the same name.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Middle C]
    The $C_4$ pitch, usually located in the middle of a keyboard (on the instrument) and always annotated in the middle of the grand staff, shared by the two staves.
\end{definition}

        \caption{The Grand Staff (a specific stave \emph{system})}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Accidental]
    A symbol placed before a note to raise / lower its pitch by a given amount.
\end{definition}

An accidental is effective only for a measure. They affect the entire piece if they are placed before the clef in a \textbf{key signature}.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|c|l}
        $\flat{}$ & Flat & $-1$ half step \\
        $\sharp{}$ & Sharp & $+1$ half step \\
        $\musDoubleFlat$ & Double flat & $-2$ half steps / $-1$ whole step \\
        $\musDoubleSharp$ & Double sharp & $+2$ half steps / $+1$ whole step \\
        $\natural{}$ & Natural & Cancels preceding accidentals \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
There exists also \textbf{half-accidentals}, whose altered notes cannot be played on a keyboard.

\begin{definition}[Half step]
    On the keyboard, the distance / interval between one key (either black or white) and the next (either black or white).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Whole step]
    The interval made up of two half steps.
\end{definition}

        \caption{Half steps and whole steps}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Enharmonic]
    Which has the same sound, but different name.
\end{definition}

\section{Rhythm}
\begin{definition}[Beat / pulse]
    The basic pulse underlying measured music and thus the unit by which musical time is reckoned.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Tempo]
    Speed of the beat.
\end{definition}
The tempo is usually expressed through metronome markings in \textbf{BPM / Beats Per Minute}.

\subsection{Time signatures}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/timesignature}
        \caption{Meaning of the time signatures}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Note / rests durations}
Both notes and rests last for certain duration, which is always a $2^n$ number of beats, where $n \in \mathbb Z$. Common values for $2^n$ are the following ones:

$$\left\{4,2,1,\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}\right\} \text{ beats}$$

Values different from these ones can be gathered through \textbf{ties} and \textbf{dots}. A dot adds $\frac{1}{2}$ the value of the note dotted, while a double dot adds $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}$ the original value.

\subsection{Meters}
\begin{definition}[Meter]
    Describes the number of beats in a measure / bar and how they are divided.
\end{definition}

\textbf{Simple meters} break the beat into 2 parts, while \textbf{compound meters} break it into 3 parts.

They can be \textbf{double} (2 beats / bar), \textbf{triple} (3 beats / bar) or \textbf{quadruple} (4 beats / bar).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/meters}
        \caption{Meters}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tuplets}
\begin{definition}[Tuplet]
    Rhythmic grouping of notes which would typically not occur in the specified meter.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Duplet / Triplet / Quadruplet / Quintuplet]
    Common tuplet instances.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Accents and syncopation}
A certain meter / time signature usually implies a certain beat hierarchy. That is, some beats are played with stronger / weaker emphases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $4/4$: $\bullet \cdot \circ \cdot$
    \item $12/8$: $\bullet \cdot \circ \cdot$ (es. \emph{Nightmare King})
    \item $2/4$: $\bullet \cdot$
    \item $6/8$: $\bullet \cdot$ (es. \emph{White Palace}, \emph{Tarantella Napoletana})
    \item $3/4$: $\bullet \cdot \cdot$ (es. \emph{Valse di Fantastica})
    \item $9/8$: $\bullet \cdot \cdot$
    \item $2/2$: $\bullet \bullet$
\end{itemize}

This should also explain why some pieces are better written as $2/4$ over $4/4$: because the beat hierarchy in the measures is different.

\begin{definition}[Downbeat]
    The first beat in a measure. Usually it is played with a very strong emphasis.
\end{definition}

Through \textbf{accents}, \textbf{ties} and \textbf{rests} it is possible to alter this rhythmic framework, obtaining \textbf{syncopation} in the process.

\begin{definition}[Syncopation]
    Playing music with a stronger emphasis on the weak beats and / or a weaker emphasis on the strong beats.
\end{definition}

Through syncopation some notes can also be played on the \emph{offbeats}.

\begin{definition}[Offbeat]
    Which is not a beat.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Irregular meters}
These meters can be explained by thinking of normal meters with an uneven beat duration. That is, every measure has a fixed number of beats, but with different beat durations.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $5/4$: 5 uneven beats (es. \emph{Mars, Bringer of War}, \emph{Cinco de Chocobo})
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $3+2: \bullet \cdot \cdot \circ \cdot$
        \item $2+3: \circ \cdot \bullet \cdot \cdot$
    \end{itemize}
    \item $7/8$: 3 uneven beats (3-2-2, 2-2-3).
    \item $13/8$: 5 uneven beats (3-3-2-2-3, etc.).
\end{itemize}
